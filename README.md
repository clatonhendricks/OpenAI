# OpenAI projects

Here are a few samples I've been playing around with OpenAI
1. iKan - A word addin to help you rewrite documents.
2. DALLEtoPPTAddin - This addin will help you create DALL-E images and also insert them to the PPT presentation.

Feel free to contribute and use it as you like, See individual ReadMe for more information.

**Note:** You will need OpenAI keys to play around with the projects. Create a account & generate the keys at www.openai.com

I created this repo just to play around with OpenAI and seek opportunities to create something helpful. Having a hacker mindset, I tend to create something that shows proof of concept. What this means is you may not find the best coding practices, error handling, proper installation packages etc. Does the code work **Yes!** Is this something you can take from releases and package and sell, absolutely **No!**. 
Regardless, everything you see is under GNU License, please read it carefully, for more clarification check it out [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/#)

I encourage you to fork or submit changes but I may or may not be able to contribute to the projects. 

## Projects

1. **iKan Word addin** - your ultimate Microsoft Word companion to assists you in writing your documents 
2. **DalletoPPT** - a simple Dalle-to-PPT addin to insert your creative imaginations into PPT

Each project comes with installation instructions in the ReadMe file.

## Installation
I am currently trying to publish this addin to the Office Addins store but untill then please follow the steps to side load the addin. Its a long painfull process üòû

1. Download iKan.xml file from the Releases page
2. Copy the .xml file to the folder and share it (I know it sounds weird). Once you share the folder, it will give you an network address e.g. \\foofighters\iKan 
3. Open Word - Options - Trust Center - Trust Center Settings - Trusted Addin-in Catalog
4. Under Trusted Catalogs  - Add the network path to the Catalog Url box and click on Add catalog. Click ok and restart Word
5. No you are not done yet (Phew!!!) - Open Word - new document or open an existing one
6. On the Home ribbon, Click on "Add-ins"  - "Get Addins". In the addin window, click on "Shared Folder" on the top and that is where you will see "iKan AI Assistant" - click on install and done. 

## Requirements

- Microsoft Word 2016 (Desktop) or newer.
- Make sure you go to OpenAI.com to get your API key 
- Active internet connection for AI features.
